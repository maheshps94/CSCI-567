This is a README file with details for execution if the normal execution file doesn't work.

The libsvm library needs to be installed to run the programs.

You can find instructions to install it at https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/

Also, if you are on a Linux machine (mine was Ubuntu) put all the code files in "libsvm/python" directory, run the command "make" to extract
libsvm files and then run the file "CSCI567"_hw3_fall16.py"

Make sure all the code files,  "svm.py" and "svmutil.py" library files are in the same folder or path.

The code files being submitted for this assignment are:
CSCI567_hw3_fall16.py
bvTradeOff.py
lkSVM.py
libsvm.py
